A better `<input type="file">`.

### What's wrong with `<input type="file">`?

1. It's difficult to skin/style as the look and feel of the element is mostly determined by the user agent.
2. Access to the selected files are provided via `FileList` object, which is a pseudo-array (not a "real" array, with useful sugar like `forEach`, etc).
3. You want any sort of file validation?  Do it yourself!
4. The API is lacking in many respects.

Now, a new, better, evolved (and evolving) element to take its place: `<file-input>`!

### And... `<file-input>` integrates perfectly with `<ajax-form>`!
Simply include a `<file-input>` in [an `<ajax-form>`](https://github.com/garstasio/ajax-form), 
ensure the `name` attribute is present on the `<file-input>`, and the `<ajax-form>` 
includes an `enctype` attriute with a value of `multipart/form-data`.  Any valid 
files will be sent along with the other form fields!  

If you incoude a `required` attribute on the `<file-input>`, `<ajax-form>` will 
even prevent the form from being submitted if there isn't at least one valid 
file selected!  Note that the validation of custom elements, such as `<file-input>`,
will first be possible in [`<ajax-form>` 1.3.0](https://github.com/garstasio/ajax-form/issues/6).

__Don't forget to [vulcanize](http://www.polymer-project.org/articles/concatenating-web-components.html)
your main/parent HTML file before deploying into production.  This will ensure
that all of your HTML imports are concatenated into one file.__
